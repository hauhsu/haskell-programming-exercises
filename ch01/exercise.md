## Combinators

Determine if each of the following are combinators or not.

1. $\lambda x . xxx$: no
2. $\lambda xy . zx$: yes
3. $\lambda xyz . xy (zx)$: no
4. $\lambda xyz . xy (zxy)$: no
5. $\lambda xy . xy(zxy)$: yes

Nomoral form or diverge?

Determine if each of the following can be reduced to a normal form or if they
diverge.

1. $\lambda x. xxx$: normal form
2. $(\lambda z . zz)(\lambda y . yy)$: diverage 
3. $(\lambda x . xxx) z$: normal form

Beta reduce 

Evaluate (that is, beta reduce) each of the following expressions to normal
form. We strongly recommend writing out the steps on paper with a pencil or
pen.
